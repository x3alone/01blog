ui still will need riuting and so on 
2. Database Design

Entities:

User: id, username, email, password, role, createdAt

Post: id, userId, description, mediaPath, createdAt

Comment: id, postId, userId, text, createdAt

Like: id, postId, userId

Subscription: id, followerId, followingId

Report: id, reportedUserId, reporterId, reason, createdAt

Define relationships:

User 1â€”* Post

Post 1â€”* Comment

Post 1â€”* Like

User *â€”* User (Subscription)

User 1â€”* Report

3. Backend Development (Spring Boot)

ðŸ‘‰ Build REST APIs in this order:

Authentication & Security

Register, Login, JWT-based authentication.

Role-based access (USER vs ADMIN).

User Block (Profile Page)

Get user info + posts.

Subscribe/Unsubscribe to users.

Fetch feed (subscribed usersâ€™ posts).

Posts

CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

Media upload (image/video).

Like + Comment endpoints.

Reports

Report user with reason + timestamp.

Admin-only access to view reports.

Admin Panel

Manage users (ban, delete).

Moderate posts (delete inappropriate).

Handle reports.

4. Frontend Development (Angular)

ðŸ‘‰ Build UI step by step:

Auth Pages

Login/Register forms with JWT handling.

Store token in localStorage.

AuthGuard for protected routes.

User Block

Profile page with posts.

Subscribe/Unsubscribe buttons.

Display followers/subscriptions.

Homepage Feed

Show posts from subscribed users.

Like & Comment functionality.

Media previews.

Post Management

Create/Edit/Delete posts.

Upload image/video with preview.

Reports

Report button with modal (reason).

Confirmation before submit.

Notifications

Simple: show new posts from subscriptions.

(Bonus) Real-time with WebSockets.

Admin Dashboard

Table of users, posts, reports.

Buttons for delete/ban.

5. Security & Testing

Secure routes with Spring Security.

Validate inputs (@Valid + DTOs).

Protect media uploads (file validation).

Unit tests (JUnit + Mockito).

API tests with Postman.

6. Docker & Deployment

Dockerize Backend:

Create Dockerfile for Spring Boot.

Use docker-compose with PostgreSQL.

Dockerize Frontend:

Build Angular app â†’ serve with Nginx.

Test containers locally.

Prepare README with setup instructions.

7. (Optional) Bonus Features

Real-time updates with WebSockets (comments, notifications).

Infinite scroll on feeds.

Dark mode toggle.

Markdown support for posts.

Admin analytics (post count, most reported users).

âš¡ Recommended Workflow:

Start backend auth first, test APIs with Postman.

Then build frontend auth pages (connect login/register).

Add features gradually (posts â†’ comments â†’ likes â†’ reports).

Finally, build admin panel and polish UI.
