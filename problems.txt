api endpoints & paths 
issues when login in it shows the credentials in the path
double check if all the paths are showing correct pages and redirect to the correct path


so far user has admin role as the first user and has ban status f or t 
i have edit and delete posts set in the back and only current user and admin that can edit/delete post 


+++ added profile and accessibility to authed user or public viewer path endpoint
 GET /api/users/{profileOwnerId}



now i need to add final touches before moving on to front end fully 
content categorization, search, notification, or commenting.


not added to the front 
--profile api
--dashboard that includes baning, promoting roles or managing posts
--commenting to back and front 
--notifs to  back and front
!! fix the ui, and make it like x, make the post maker in home not another endpoint


i have to add it to  routes.compoent 

http://localhost:4200/api/users/%7B1%7D this should be n error  404


project wise i need to change security to signals in the whole project and make it real time
