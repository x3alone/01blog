 outsiders shouldnt see like svg  
 comments arent deletable by  their authors 
 likes dont appear in notifications

 replace delete post with normal svg like i have on home component on class="list-item report-item" actions and hide svg  to the dashboard list-item report-item action so admins hide posts
speaking about reports can u inhance the class="list-item report-item" and add media preview on right part of card svgs of button actions on top corner and order the meta date make it to the right of the card and
