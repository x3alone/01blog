 >need to add rate limit to comments 

-add hide to posts only admin can hide and then only admin can see the posts that are hidden 
-add delete user in dashboard 
-add postid routing (the name of tap will be the title of post) so i can see only one post if i click on a post, thus lower the size of posts to realistic size that shows both image and video forms 

posts fixed size media, and in the edit i should be also able to edit the uploaded media whether remove it or remplace it with another one that i can upload 
add scroll bar in notification and remove that stacking of following and notifs but keep the 5 notif line
try to  remove extra colors from dash board even white on posts and remove hover action on posts,
try to lower or darken the background color  maybe lower radius if the posts form  1e1e1e color (  1e1e1e black ish)

>add scroll to comments  and fix its size 
>remove logo and displace home to right top
